# RS232 / RS232 levy 

Keypad is connected to ARDUINO Mega2560 with/without adapter. When a key is pressed, analog signal is sent to ARDUINO and digitized. 

RS232 provides reliable communication protocol. The kit is connected to ARDUINO with TX and RX pins. 5V VCC and GND is required for RS232 kit. 

## Files:
  rs232.h contains pin mapping configuration, bitrate, and function prototypes 
  rs232.cpp contains function implementations

## Functions definitions:

   void rs232_init()	  
      	Function initalizes RX and TX pins of ARDUINO

   void write_char(int data)
   	Funtion sends a character with "9600/8n1" setting

   void write_string(char const * data)
   	Function sends a string (terminated with '\0') with "9600/8n1" setting.

   int read_char()
       Function reads received character and returns an integer value (ASCII)


## USE: 
- Create new proj in ARDUINO IDE
- Move .cpp and .h files to same folder
- Copy and replace exampleX file to main file
